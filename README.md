# Course contents
This repository encapsulates the entire coursework of the "Programming I" course focusing on various aspects of programming fundamentals. It covers basic programming, data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and handling exceptions. This course is structured into foundational units (OU1 - OU5) and extended units (EU1 - EU4), each diving deeper into specific programming paradigms and challenges.

## Fundamental constructs:
* Basic syntax and semantics of a higher-level language
* Variables, types, expressions and assignment
* Simple I/O
* Conditional and iterative control structures
* Functions and parameter passing
* Structured decomposition

## Data structures:
* Representation of numeric data
* Range, precision, and rounding errors
* Arrays
* Representation of character data
* Strings and string processing
* Runtime storage management
* Pointers and references

## Algorithmic problem solving:
* Problem-solving strategies
* The role of algorithms in the problem-solving process
* Implementation strategies for algorithms
* Debugging strategies
* The concept and properties of algorithms

## Object-oriented programming:
* Object-oriented design
* Encapsulation and information-hiding
* Separation of behavior and implementation
* Classes and subclasses
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Exceptions:
* Exception handling
